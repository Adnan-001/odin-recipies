# odin-recipies

After learning the "Basics HTML" part from the course, "theodinproject.com" , I did this assignment which was given at the end of the lesson.

The project/assignment has 4 iterations.

I also got to experience git in action for my first actual project.

Aside from basic HTML tags and basic Git commands, I learned a bit about "git commit --amend -m" and "git rebase -i"
