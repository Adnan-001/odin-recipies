    <p>
        After a good meal there is always more room to eat a delicious desert, specially when it is a Strawberry cupcake. Well these are not necessarily to be served as an after meal desert, you can eat enough to make it both a meal and and a desert (hehe strawberry cupcakes FTW!).

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line muffin tins with 20 cupcake liners (for mini cupcakes, line 72 mini muffin tins).
        </li>

        <li>
            Grind strawberries into a fine powder using a coffee grinder or food processor. Whisk strawberry powder, all-purpose flour, cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
        </li>

        <li>
            Beat butter and sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in vanilla extract.
        </li>

        <li>
            Stir flour mixture, alternately with the milk, into butter mixture until just incorporated. Fill lined tins with cupcake batter.
        </li>

        <li>
            Bake in preheated oven until cupcakes spring back when gently touched with a fingertip or a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 16 to 18 minutes for regular cupcakes, 8 to 10 minutes for mini cupcakes.
        </li>

    </ol>
